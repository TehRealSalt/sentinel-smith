# Sentinel Smith

"Sentinel Smith" is a modern map editor for [Doom](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2280/DOOM__DOOM_II/) and its derivatives, built in the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).

This is designed with [Snap the Sentinel](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1739960/Snap_the_Sentinel/) in mind as the primary target. This would be the [Universal Doom Map Format](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/UDMF), with namespace ["zdoom"](https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom), and no assumptions made about the game's contents. However, support for any other Doom-based games are welcome, as long as they don't interfere with this target!

## How to use

Currently, there are no pre-built releases. This will come in the future when the project has more features and is more stable.

To import into Godot, open the Project Manager, click the "Import" button, and navigate to the `/project` folder. It will then be added to your project list in the future. After opening the project, you can make changes to the project, or export a build.

This project is currently designed with Godot 4.5 in mind. If any issues with importing occur, make sure you are using this version.

Example UDMF map files for any testing cases are included within `/test-files`.
