# Introduction

Thank you for interest in contributing to "Sentinel Smith"!

Following these guidelines help show that you respect the project developers' time, and that effort will be reciprocated in helping fix your issues and finalize your pull requests.

Contributions that are greatly welcomed include (but are not limited to!) bug reports, feature requests, code improvements, documentation, and test case map files.

However, please avoid using the issue tracker for tech support questions. Currently, there is no channel for these questions, as this is early beta software.

# Code contributions

The following responsibilities are expected of code contributions:

- Ensure that Godot is not outputting any warnings or errors because of your changes.
- If possible, ensure cross-platform compatibility to any of your code.
  - Godot has fantastic cross-platform support out-of-the-box, so this is typically resolved by simply not submitting code with warnings.
  - This mainly becomes important if any non-Godot code or tools are ever added.
- Add [documentation comments to any GDScript code](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_documentation_comments.html).
- Ensure that you have tested your changes.
  - If possible, write testing instructions for others to follow.
- Ensure that your code is compatible with the MIT license.
  - This means that code taken directly from other Doom projects is usually forbidden, as they are typically GPL.
